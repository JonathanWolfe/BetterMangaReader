# BetterMangaReader
Enjoy a better manga reading experience and with less hassle by letting us keep track of all your mangas and letting you know when each have been updated. BMR also displays every page of your manga onto one page so that you can just scroll downward to keep reading instead of going page to page, one by one.

This is still in beta, and as such is limited to only working on:
- MangaHere
- MangaTown
- MangaStream

During the beta, it's always helpful if you find any bugs to report them here under the issues tab and maybe if you're feeling spry, knock out a couple of the fixes yourself and submit a pull request.
