#BetterMangaReader

Enjoy a better manga reading experience and with less hassle by letting us keep track of all your mangas and letting you know when each have been updated. Also included are different reading modes like waterfall (all pages on 1 page) and book (2 pages side by side like they were originally printed) instead of the one-page style you see on sites.
